<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Keepr is a social network that allows users to visually share and discover new interests by posting images or videos to their own, or others', collections (i.e., a collection of 'vaults,' usually with a common theme) and browsing what other users have kept.
<ul>
   <li>Implement Vue, Vue-Router, and Masonry Layout to create a responsive, interactive front-end experience, efficiently organizing content using an adaptive grid       structure for seamless cross-device compatibility.</li>
   <li>With C# and .NET I created a robust backend to manage and store data, leveraging the power of these technologies to ensure high performance and scalability for     Keepr.</li>
   <li>Auth0 Integration: Implemented secure user authentication and identity management, bolstering the platform's overall security and providing a safe user            experience.</li>
</ul>


Languages Utilized: Vue, C# JavaScript, SCSS, HTML, .NET, Express, Bootstrap

<!-- Goal of the Project -->
## Goals

In this final checkpoint, students will demonstrate a working knowledge of building full-stack applications. They will utilize a VueJs frontend with Vue-Router to manage the DOM. On the server-side, students will use the DotNet WebApi for their server and implement the Repository pattern to communicate with their database. In addition, students will use Auth0 for user management, Dapper as an ORM, and a MySQL server for their database.
